Cgi Assignment SPA SimpelMovie

Preview.

First thoughts were hopeful when I was reading assignment. 
Unfortunately, I was reading diagonally so I missed the technology part.
As I understood that .net is the requirement I started to look for tutorials.
So the first one what popped up was Create a web app with ASP.NET Core MVC: 
https://docs.microsoft.com/et-ee/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/?view=aspnetcore-3.1. 
Steps.
So I started with tutorial https://docs.microsoft.com/et-ee/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/?view=aspnetcore-3.1
Then I tried to implement repository - service- controller layout
based on my experience with Java. I wasted 21 hours for that.
Then I realised that this is not working like that in the .net world.
Since I had taken Sunday off for family I started again Monday morning.
So I found another tutorial Implementing the Repository and 
Unit of Work Patterns in an ASP.NET MVC Application.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions/getting-started-with-ef-5-using-mvc-4/implementing-the-repository-and-unit-of-work-patterns-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application#implement-a-generic-repository-and-a-unit-of-work-class
then I tried to implement that logic to my project 
I ended up getting some errors on making requests from the front end.  
This took me about 18 hours and React part was missing at all. 
So Wednesday morning I started to  Make things happening in React. 
Since that was familiar to me there weren't that many issues.
So Since React is more familiar to me I can explain what I used.
so for displaying data, I used React Bootstrap Table feature.
That also includes search and pagination options. 
So local search can be performed from data received from the database. 
For displaying movie data and description I used simple modal from @trendmicro.
Since my front and back are not communicating in the way they should, 
but the front should show some data I used mocraroo for creating dummy data. 
So every time the app is loaded data is fetched from  mocaroo. 
I used axios for that because it is again more familiar to me. 
To get the idea what I have done previously with java you can 
watch my repo in github: https://github.com/viljarsoots/
I was using visual studio for developing. At some point for front end only Visual Studio Code.
Because it was easyer to follow.
